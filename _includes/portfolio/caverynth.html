            Short 2D skill-based platformer. At the time of making this game I was obsessed with the game <b>Celeste</b>. I wanted to make a platformer that, like Celeste, featured levels challenging both the player's <b>mechanical</b> and<b>problem-solving</b> skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game features 12 levels all built over the previous one. Starting from a simple walk, <b>in each level a new obstacle is added</b> to the course.<br>
            This creates the feeling of repeating the same level, while <b>progressively adding challenge</b>, either via skill checks in which the player needs to be precise, or "puzzle" obstacles, which require thinking to find the path to the end of the level. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This game was an excellent chance for exploring 2D level design, and playing with the new Unity 2D lighting system and the particle system.

            Caverynth acquired some popularity in GameJolt.com, occupying one of the <b>top positions in the Platformer - Hot</b> category. 
            It was also one of the games selected to be featured in <a href="https://indiemad.org/cuarentena-perpetua/videojuegos-2/" target="_blank">Cuarentena Perpetua</a>, an online showcase of Spanish videogames ran by IndieMad.
